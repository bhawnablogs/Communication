# Communication
Some Code about two way communication via Socket in C#
This is the code to do 2 way commnucation between multiple  PC's as 1 server and multiple clients.
Make one PC as server run server code on that.
Have multiple PC's as Client and put Client Code for each PC.Just change the IP address to Server to which you want to connect.
Now send something from Server you would get on Client and then send something from Client you would get on server.
